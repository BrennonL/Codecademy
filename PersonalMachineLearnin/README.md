# Overview



My project is iterating through a data set using python to both plot the data and find the line of best fit. I did this to practice some machine learning equations. My streatch challenge was to graph my data.

# Machine Leanring Results

What I did was plot the data and found the line of best fit. The data I extracted was about resting heart-rate and how that corisponed with with the number of heart disease. This will allow the computer to predict heart disease.

# Development Environment

I used python 3, VS code, a data set about heart disease, the matplotlib.pyplot library, and the statistics library.

# Future Work

Things to work on in the future:
* I need to pay more attention to the parenthesis that I put down because I ran into a few issuse during this assignment with parenthesis.
* Next time I will also take more time to understand the equations needed for machine learning because I brushed over them this sprint and I suffered from it in the end.
* The final thing I need to work on is making sure I re-plan when my current plan fails because this last time I didn't do that and I felt lost for a time on what I was suposed to be doing.
